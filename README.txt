ConfigFileParser README
************************

This is a Java class/package I'm working on that I thought other people may be able to use. It takes a config file and parses the entries it finds to a specified class in your project. It is easy to use, but at the moment is not particularly powerful or all-purpose. If you find it useful, though, feel free to use it and/or update it.
